# s7netplus
#### A .NET Library for Siemens S7 Connectivity

## Overview

S7.Net Plus is a continuation of the work done on the [S7.Net](http://s7net.codeplex.com/) project by [Juergen1969](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/juergen1969).
I found the library simple and effective, but the project has languished unchanged since late 2009.

I was doing some automation work already and saw a few places where the code base could be improved. Because Juergen did not respond
to my request for committing code, I decided to pick up where he left off here on GitHub.
